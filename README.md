# ImageWeave Web App

ImageWeave is a web application built using Python, Django API, and Streamlit that allows users to upload images and generate texture maps from them. The generated texture maps can be shared online and used in other projects.

## Features

- **Image Upload:** Users can upload images in various formats such as JPG, PNG, and BMP.

- **Texture Map Generation:** ImageWeave generates texture maps from the uploaded images using advanced algorithms.

- **Online Sharing:** Users can share the generated texture maps online via a common gallery repository, making it easy to use them in other projects.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The core programming language used to develop ImageWeave.

- **Django API:** The web framework used to create the back-end of the application.

- **Streamlit:** The front-end framework used to create the user interface.

## Usage

To use ImageWeave, simply navigate to the web app and follow the on-screen instructions to upload an image and generate a texture map. Once generated, you can share the texture map online by copying the unique URL.

## Conclusion

ImageWeave is a minimal responsive web application that allows users to generate high-quality texture maps from images and share them online. Its intuitive user interface and well established cv algorithms make it easy to use and produce impressive results.
